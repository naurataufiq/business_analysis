## 📘 Project Overview

This project explores the relationships between Yelp business reviews in Toronto and their proximity to popular tourist attractions. Using data from the **Yelp Open Dataset** and **Toronto Open Data API**, we examine how business ratings, review sentiments, and types of services are potentially influenced by nearby attractions.

The main objectives of this project are:
- To clean and merge large-scale Yelp and city datasets efficiently.
- To conduct meaningful exploratory data analysis (EDA) on business reviews.
- To develop predictive models that incorporate spatial proximity to attractions as a feature.

## 📊 Key Methods

- Spatial filtering using KDTree for nearest attraction mapping.
- Text preprocessing and duplicate handling in reviews.
- Geographical data validation and feature engineering.
- Machine learning models for predicting business rating and review volume.
